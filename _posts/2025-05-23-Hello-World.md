We’re excited to welcome you to the official website of our DS-NLP Lab. 

This platform marks a new chapter for us—one where we not only advance research behind the scenes, but also share our journey with the world. We created this website to offer a window into our ongoing work, discoveries, and collaborations. From academic findings to applied insights, this space will keep you up to date with the progress we’re making in the different fields we are currently working on.

As a research lab and chair, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with language and data. But we’re equally committed to openness, communication, dialogue and teaching. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a student, an industry partner, or just curious about what we do—we’re glad you’re here.

You’ll find updates, research highlights, team news, and project showcases. 

Thanks for visiting—and stay tuned!
