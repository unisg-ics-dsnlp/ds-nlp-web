#  Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4

Financial equity research reports (ERRs) are the way banks and independent analyst firms communicate their buy and sell recommendations about individual stocks. Typically, financial experts, so-called "analysts," cover a basket of stock-listed companies from one or two industries over a long period of time, and update their ERRs whenever important news come out (often after quarterly reports) [36].

ERRs typically contain a stock price target as well as a buy, hold, or sell recommendation.

The banks' clients and the general market use these reports to support investment decisions in the stocks (and, to a lesser extent, bonds) of these companies.

## Financial Text -- One Hard Nut to Crack for Automation

### Relevance

In the financial literature, ERRs are established as important sources of information [44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. They offer some insight into the future stock performance of firms [49], so they may indeed help investors to make decisions.

### Issues With Financial Equity Research: Bias and Cost

But a problem remains: Many reports are written by banks, and banks have an inherent interest in earning commissions from trades places by their clients. This means they often want to convince (potential) clients to buy stocks, possibly introducing a reluctance to publish negative coverage [42, 43]. [36] found that only 0.5% of all reports contained sell recommendations before the dot-com bubble burst. Prior research showed less extreme results, with 14% sell recommendations between 1989 and 1991 [49], but the direction is still clear: ERRs seem to be a tad to positive and not entirely unbiased.

Another issue with ERRs are cost. As our results below show, much of equity research is just a presentation of financials. Overall, ERRs follow a mechanistic, descriptive pattern. It is thus questionable if significant human input is warranted and useful. Given the concerns around biasedness in equity research, the field may thus benefit from further autmation. Our paper provides the groundwork for systematic automation of equity research.

{% include section.html %}
## The Structure of Equity Research

While research about the relevance and biasedness of equity research is plentiful, we know very little about what types of statements these reports make. So far, there was no systematic research into the structure of financial equity research reports -- so that is where our research comes in.

Let's start with the basics: Equity research reports are consistently short. Unlike annual reports, which usually have hundreds of pages, equity research is short and concise, and reports with 20 pages are long outliers already. 

The figures below illustrate that most reports have between 4 and 9 pages, and they do not contain more than 120 statements.

<div style="text-align: center;">

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <sup style="text-align: center;">Different types of information are systematically presented with different modes of display. Financial information is often structured enough to be displayed in tables and diagrams, while company and market overviews are usually verbal.</sup>
  </p>
</div>

## How Do Banks and Independent Analysts Present Their Analyses?

We found that text and tables are the dominant ways of conveying information in equity research reports. Diagrams, which often come in the form of stock price charts, are less relevant overall. Custom diagrams that show complex business relationships, product specifications, or market dynamics, are an absolute exception.

Textual and tabular statement can often be expressed in various ways, and analysts switch between textual and tabular modes. Different banks tend to have different styles. Some make heavy use of tables, while others present almost all information in text form. This heavy reliance on text and tables is a potential for LLMs, as text and tables are the native domain of language models. Today's language models can write tables in Markdown or in other machine-readable formats.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ page.image_venn_diagram_modalities_in_equity_research_reports }}" alt="There is significant overlap between presentation modes for the same statements. Textual and tabular representation modes are dominant." style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <sup style="text-align: center;">There is significant overlap between presentation modes for the same statements. Textual and tabular representation modes are dominant.</sup>
  </p>
</div>

Analysts have a strong bias in favor of the type of information that they know best: Financials. This is reflected in the following diagram, which shows that most statements fall into the "Financials" category. As mentioned above, analysts usually do not take the time to present product-specific diagrams or to display market dynamics or supply chains in graphical form. The category "Product"  illustrates.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ page.image_question_categories_bars }}" alt="Statements about the income statement (profit & loss -- P&L) are the most frequent question subcategory in our typology. Most of the other top subcategories also fall in the Financials subcategory. An exception is the Stock Price subcategory, which is the second most important subcategory by frequency." style="width: 45%; height: auto;">

## How Large is the Dent That LLMs Can Make in Automating Equity Research?

According to our research, already 55% of the statements from equity research reports are automatable, even without any use of AI/LLMs. This is due to the comprehensive data coverage that financial databases such as Bloomberg provide. Executive changes, financials, and subsidiary structures are readily available in structured format in these databases. 

Thus, to evaluate the automation potential that LLMs can still have, we substracted this 55% from the overall pie, and ended up with 30% of automation potential for LLMs. Thus, only 15% of statements in ERRs cannot be automated.

Of these 30%, 26 percentage points were answered correctly by GPT-4, and 27 percentage points were answered correctly by Llama-3. The error rate is reduced when a perfect ensemble of these two models is assumed, as we show below.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="{{ page.image_evaluation_gpt4_llama3__pie_charts_correct_incorrect }}" alt="Language models can close a gap that financial databases leave open. Still, we think that human input is still required, as we assume non-fact based statements (opinions) and strategic outlooks cannot be automated by LLMs." style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

  </p>
</div>

{% include section.html %}
## Potential for Model Ensembles

We found that GPT-4 and Llama-3 complement each other. In our small-scale analysis, when one of the models fails to answer a question correctly, the other model almost always is able to "help out."

This result shows that there is potential in multi-AI (or multi-agent) systems that outperform single-model inference. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

    alt="Accuracy and error rate for GPT-4 and Llama-3. GPT-4: 52 right, 8 wrong. Llama-3: 54 right, 6 wrong. Ensemble: 59 right, 1 wrong. Shows that ensembles have promising potential."

    style="width: 20%; height: auto;"
  >
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <sup style="text-align: center;">Ensembles of GPT-4 and Llama-3 have high potential as they show little error overlap.</sup>
  </p>
</div>


{% include section.html %} 
## Conclusion

The study shows some patterns in equity research worth pointing out:

<ul>
  
  <li> 
    Analysts usually do not create custom diagrams that deep-dive into product specifications, distribution or supply chains, market structures, or other complex relationships that underly the covered firms' business. In fact, only 15% of the statements financial analysts make are hard to automate by LLMs in principle, as these represent strategic outlooks or opinions. Thus, the automation potential of equity research is high, as their "human touch" is already minuscle today. 
  </li>

  <li>
    Most of the statements in financial report relate to financial information -- which can already be found in financial databases and does not require LLMs to be extracted.
  </li>

  <li>
    We still need to caution that analysts perform important roles that LLMs will not be able to replicate. For example, they personally meet management teams and may get subtle clues about the confidence and capabilities of these managers in these meetings.
  </li>

</ul>

{% include section.html %} 
## Outlook

Today's ERRs heavily focus on financials. This probably arises from the skill set of their authors. Most financial analysts have degrees in business and finance, and these analysts are usually no product or service experts in the industries that they cover. LLMs offer potential for more holistic coverage that takes product and service quality of the covered firms into account, introducing an underappreciated aspect to equity research.
