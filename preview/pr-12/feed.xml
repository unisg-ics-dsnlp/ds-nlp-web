<p>Financial equity research reports (ERRs) are a means to communicate buy and sell recommendations about individual stocks. Banks and independent research firms write those reports to convince their clients to buy or sell stocks (earning the banks a brokerage commission), or to receive direct compensation for their research. Typically, financial experts, so-called “analysts,” cover a basket of stock-listed companies from one or two industries over a long period of time, and update their ERRs whenever important news come out (often after quarterly reports) [36].</p>

<p>ERRs typically contain a stock price target (e.g., a forecasted stock price of $250 per share within the next 12 months) as well as a buy, hold, or sell recommendation.</p>

<p>The banks’ clients and the general market use these reports to support investment decisions in the stocks (and, to a lesser extent, bonds) of these companies.</p>

<h3 id="relevance">Relevance</h3>

<p>In the financial literature, ERRs are established as important sources of information [44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. They offer some empirically validated insights into the future stock performance of firms [49], so they may indeed help investors to make decisions.</p>

<h3 id="issues-with-financial-equity-research-bias-and-cost">Issues With Financial Equity Research: Bias and Cost</h3>

<p>But a problem remains: Many reports are written by banks, and banks have an inherent interest in earning commissions from trades placed by their clients. This means they often want to convince (potential) clients to buy stocks, possibly introducing a reluctance to publish negative coverage [42, 43]. [36] found that only 0.5% of all reports contained sell recommendations before the dot-com bubble burst. Prior research showed less extreme results, with 14% sell recommendations between 1989 and 1991 [49], but the direction is still clear: ERRs seem to be a tad to positive and not entirely unbiased.</p>

<p>Another issue with ERRs are cost. As our results below show, much of equity research is just a presentation of financials. Overall, ERRs follow a mechanistic, descriptive pattern. It is thus questionable if significant human input is warranted and useful. Given the concerns around biasedness in equity research, the field may thus benefit from further automation. Our paper provides the groundwork for systematic automation of equity research.</p>

<h2 id="the-structure-of-equity-research">The Structure of Equity Research</h2>

<p>While research about the relevance and biasedness of equity reports is plentiful, there is little understanding about what types of contents these reports cover and to what extent the context might be automated. So far, there was no systematic research into the structure of financial equity research reports – so that is where our research comes in. Based on 72 English equity research reports written between 2018 and 2022, covering a broad range of authors (banks) and covered companies, we empirically uncover how equity analysts write.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the basics: Equity research reports are consistently short. Unlike annual reports, which usually have hundreds of pages, equity research is short and concise, and reports with 20 pages are long outliers already.</p>

<p>The figures below illustrate that most reports have between 4 and 9 pages, and they do not contain more than 120 statements.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-banks-and-independent-analysts-present-their-analyses">How Do Banks and Independent Analysts Present Their Analyses?</h2>

<p>In our study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327">Pop &amp; Spörer (2025)</a>, we found that text and tables are the dominant ways of conveying information in equity research reports. Diagrams, which often come in the form of stock price charts, are less relevant overall. Custom diagrams that show complex business relationships, product specifications, or market dynamics, are an absolute exception.</p>

<p>Textual and tabular statement can often be expressed in various ways, and analysts switch between textual and tabular modes. Different banks tend to have different styles. Some make heavy use of tables, while others present almost all information in text form. This heavy reliance on text and tables is a potential for LLMs, as text and tables are the native domain of language models. Today’s language models can write tables in Markdown or in other machine-readable formats.</p>

  </p>
</div>

<p>Analysts have a strong bias in favor of the type of information that they know best: Financials. This is reflected in the following diagram, which shows that most statements fall into the “Financials” category. As mentioned above, analysts usually do not take the time to present product-specific diagrams or to display market dynamics or supply chains in graphical form. The category “Product”  illustrates.</p>

<h2 id="how-large-is-the-dent-that-llms-can-make-in-automating-equity-research">How Large is the Dent That LLMs Can Make in Automating Equity Research?</h2>

<p>According to our research, already 55% of the statements from equity research reports are automatable, even without any use of AI/LLMs. This is due to the comprehensive data coverage that financial databases such as Bloomberg provide. Executive changes, financials, and subsidiary structures are readily available in structured format in these databases.</p>

<p>Thus, to evaluate the automation potential that LLMs can still have, we substracted this 55% from the overall pie, and ended up with 30% of automation potential for LLMs. Thus, only 15% of statements in ERRs cannot be automated.</p>

<p>Of these 30%, 26 percentage points were answered correctly by GPT-4, and 27 percentage points were answered correctly by Llama-3. The error rate is reduced when a perfect ensemble of these two models is assumed, as we show below.</p>

<p>We found that GPT-4 and Llama-3 complement each other. In our small-scale analysis, when one of the models fails to answer a question correctly, the other model almost always is able to “help out.”</p>

<p>This result shows that there is potential in multi-AI (or multi-agent) systems that outperform single-model inference.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The study shows some patterns in equity research worth pointing out:</p>

<ul>

  <li> 
    Analysts usually do not create custom diagrams that deep-dive into product specifications, distribution or supply chains, market structures, or other complex relationships that underly the covered firms' business. In fact, only 15% of the statements financial analysts make are hard to automate by LLMs in principle, as these represent strategic outlooks or opinions. Thus, the automation potential of equity research is high, as their "human touch" is already minuscle today. 
  </li>

  <li>
    Most of the statements in financial report relate to financial information -- which can already be found in financial databases and does not require LLMs to be extracted.
  </li>

  <li>
    We still need to caution that analysts perform important roles that LLMs will not be able to replicate. For example, they personally meet management teams and may get subtle clues about the confidence and capabilities of these managers in these meetings.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>Today’s ERRs heavily focus on financials. This probably arises from the skill set of their authors. Most financial analysts have degrees in business and finance, and these analysts are usually no product or service experts in the industries that they cover. LLMs offer potential for more holistic coverage that takes product and service quality of the covered firms into account, introducing an underappreciated aspect to equity research.</p>

            This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by systematically mapping their content into categories. There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4964 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions’ potential for automation. Answers were labeled “text-extractable” if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports. 75.15% of the questions in ERRs can be automated using text extraction from text sources. Those automatable questions consist of 51.91% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 24.24% database-extractable questions. Only 24.85% of questions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate, using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and infor- mation extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses well, indicating strong ensemble potential. The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, are available online (link removed to preserve anonymity).

<p>On September 2, 2025, the <strong>Swiss AI Initiative</strong> — a collaboration between ETH Zurich, EPFL, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) — released the <strong>Apertus model family</strong> in two sizes: <strong>8B</strong> and <strong>70B parameters</strong>.</p>

<p>The larger variant, <strong>Apertus-70B</strong>, is the first fully open model trained at this scale, developed on 4,096 GPUs using 15 trillion tokens.</p>

<p>The models are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trained solely on publicly available data</li>
  <li>Respectful of robots.txt exclusions (retroactively)</li>
  <li>Filtered for copyrighted, non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content</li>
  <li>Equipped with the <em>Goldfish</em> loss to limit verbatim memorization</li>
</ul>

<p>Apertus supports <strong>1,811 languages</strong>, including Swiss regional languages such as <em>Romansh</em> and <em>Schwiizerdütsch</em>. The release includes both the <strong>model weights</strong> and <strong>full reproduction artifacts</strong> for the research community.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarking-the-model">Benchmarking the Model</h2>
<p>We took the opportunity to benchmark the model against other models using several industry-standard benchmarks.</p>

<p>The <strong>technical report</strong>[1] already contains comparisons with common open weight and open source models. Our goal was to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get our own impressions of Apertus</li>
  <li>Evaluate whether we could reproduce the benchmarks presented in the report</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, we highly recommend everyone take a look at the technical report for the Apertus models. It is relatively rare to find such detailed insights into <strong>state-of-the-art LLM trainings</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="open-weight-vs-open-models">Open Weight vs. Open Models</h2>
<p>In this article, we follow the terminology used by the editors of the Technical Report and draw a clear distinction:</p>

<h3 id="open-weight-models">Open Weight Models</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Weights and architectures are openly available</li>
  <li>Training data, scripts, and reproducibility artifacts are not published</li>
  <li><strong>Example:</strong> <em>Llama model family</em> from Meta</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-models">Open Models</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strive to make <em>everything</em> open: data, scripts, training details</li>
  <li>Aim for reproducibility and knowledge sharing in a scientific context</li>
  <li><strong>Example:</strong> <em>OLMO model family</em> from the Allen Institute for AI</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-open-models-matter">Why Open Models Matter</h2>
<p>Although open models often lag behind open weight and closed models (e.g., GPT-5 from OpenAI, or Gemini) in performance, they provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Training on <strong>ethical datasets</strong></li>
  <li>Development on a <strong>non-profit basis</strong></li>
  <li>Opportunities for <strong>open research</strong> that is not profit-driven</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite their current limitations in quality compared to top-tier chat applications, open models are <strong>extremely important</strong> for society. They advance the entire field of <strong>LLM Foundation Training research</strong> through transparency, reproducibility, and community-driven progress.</p>

<h4 id="important-notes-on-ifeval-comparison">Important Notes on IFEval Comparison:</h4>

<p>The performance differences between our results and the Tech Report can be attributed to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evaluation Implementation Differences</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Different prompt templates and formatting</li>
      <li>Variations in instruction parsing and evaluation criteria</li>
      <li>Potential differences in the lm-evaluation-harness versions (See <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ai/lm-evaluation-harness">github.com/swiss-ai/lm-evaluation-harness</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Consistency Across Models</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Both Apertus-8B-Instruct and OLMo-2-7B-Instruct show lower scores in our evaluation</li>
      <li>The consistent gap suggests systematic differences in evaluation methodology</li>
      <li>This highlights the importance of using identical evaluation settings for fair comparisons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This may not necessarily mean that the results are directly comparable with the official benchmarks. However, this does not affect the comparability between the models in our benchmark.</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of natural language processing, two major paradigms have shaped how we build language models: the <strong>Attention Mechanism</strong> that powers Transformers [2], and the recently revived <strong>State Space Models</strong> (SSMs) [3,4]. While these approaches seem fundamentally different at first glance, our recent work “Integrating the Attention Mechanism Into State Space Models”[1] presented at the IEEE Swiss Conference on Data Science reveals surprising connections and proposes a way to combine their strengths.</p>

<h2 id="the-tale-of-two-architectures">The Tale of Two Architectures</h2>

<h3 id="attention-mechanisms-the-context-masters">Attention Mechanisms: The Context Masters</h3>

<p>The attention mechanism, popularized by the “Attention is All You Need” paper [2], works by allowing each token in a sequence to “look at” all previous tokens and decide which ones are most relevant for the current prediction.</p>

<p>Think of it like this: when you’re reading a sentence and trying to understand what “it” refers to, you automatically scan back through the text to find the most likely candidate. The attention mechanism does something similar - it computes similarity scores between tokens and uses these to create weighted combinations of past information.</p>

<p>Mathematically, for a token at position i, attention computes:</p>

<p>$$y_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a_{i,j} x_j W_V W_O$$</p>

<p>Where $a_{i,j}$ represents how much attention token i pays to token j, computed using query-key similarity:</p>

<p>$$a_{i,j} = \text{softmax}(x_j W_K W_Q^T x_i^T)$$</p>

<h3 id="state-space-models-the-memory-keepers">State Space Models: The Memory Keepers</h3>

<p>State Space Models take a different approach. Instead of looking back at all previous tokens directly, they maintain a “memory state” that gets updated as each new token arrives. This state vector acts like a continuously updating summary of everything seen so far.</p>

<p>The SSM update equations are elegantly simple:</p>

<p>$$h_i = h_{i-1} A + x_i B \quad \text{(update memory)}$$</p>

<p>$$y_i = h_i C \quad \text{(generate output)}$$</p>

<p>Here, $h_i$ is the memory state, and matrices $A$, $B$, $C$ control how information flows through the system.</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-connection-two-sides-of-the-same-coin">The Hidden Connection: Two Sides of the Same Coin</h2>

<p>Here’s where something truly remarkable emerges from our analysis. Despite looking completely different on the surface, attention mechanisms and state space models are actually solving the same problem in surprisingly similar ways.</p>

<p>When we carefully expand the mathematical equations for both approaches, something amazing happens.</p>

<figure class="figure">
  <a class="figure-image" aria-label="figure link">
    <img src="/preview/pr-12/images/posts/SDS-PaperFormulars-AttentionVsSSM.png" style="
        width: auto;

  </a>
  
</figure>

<p>Both are saying: <strong>“Take each past token, multiply it by some weight, and add them all up.”</strong></p>

<p>The profound realization is that both mechanisms are computing <strong>weighted averages</strong> of past information - they just calculate the weights differently:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Attention weights</strong> ($W_{i,j}$): “How relevant is this past token to what I’m trying to understand right now?” (content-based)</li>
  <li><strong>SSM weights</strong> ($V_{i,j}$): “How much should this past token influence me, given how long ago it was?” (position-based with exponential decay)</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attention</strong> is like a smart librarian who picks the most relevant books for your research question, regardless of when they were written</li>
  <li><strong>SSMs</strong> are like your memory - recent events are vivid and influential, while older memories fade gradually but systematically</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p>

<p>This connection reveals that the attention vs. SSM debate isn’t about choosing completely different approaches - it’s about choosing different strategies for the same fundamental task: <strong>deciding how much weight to give to different pieces of past information</strong>.</p>

<p>Understanding this similarity opens up new possibilities: What if we could combine the best of both worlds? What if we could create systems that are both computationally efficient like SSMs AND contextually smart like attention?</p>

<p>From a signal processing perspective:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attention behaves like a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter</strong>: It needs separate parameters for each possible input position</li>
  <li><strong>SSMs behave like Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters</strong>: They use feedback and memory, making them more parameter-efficient</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-trade-off-context-vs-efficiency">The Trade-off: Context vs Efficiency</h2>

<p>This reveals the fundamental trade-off:</p>

<h3 id="attentions-strength-context-awareness">Attention’s Strength: Context Awareness</h3>
<p>Attention excels at capturing which past tokens are contextually relevant, regardless of their position. If “John” appears 50 tokens back but is crucial for understanding the current sentence, attention can focus on it directly.</p>

<h3 id="ssms-strength-computational-efficiency">SSM’s Strength: Computational Efficiency</h3>
<p>SSMs process sequences in linear time and use far fewer parameters. Their memory state provides a compact summary of the entire past sequence, making them ideal for very long sequences where attention’s quadratic complexity becomes prohibitive. Recent advances like Mamba [5] have shown how to make SSMs even more efficient with selective state spaces.</p>

<h3 id="the-limitation">The Limitation</h3>
<p>SSMs struggle with explicit context modeling - they can’t easily decide that a distant token is more important than a recent one based on semantic similarity. This limitation has been a key motivator for recent work like Mamba [5] and other SSM variants [6,7].</p>

<h2 id="our-proposed-solution-context-aware-ssms">Our Proposed Solution: Context-Aware SSMs</h2>

<p>We propose enhancing SSMs with a similarity mechanism inspired by attention. Instead of measuring similarity between current and past tokens (like attention does), we measure similarity between the current token and the current memory state:</p>

<p>$$g(x_i, h_{i-1}) = \sigma(x_i W_H h_{i-1}^T)$$</p>

<p>This similarity score then weights the input:</p>

<p>$$h_i = h_{i-1} A + x_i g(x_i, h_{i-1}) B$$</p>

<p>$$y_i = h_i C$$</p>

<h3 id="the-intuition">The Intuition</h3>

<p>Think of the memory state $h_{i-1}$ as containing a compressed representation of all past context. When a new token $x_i$ arrives, we check how well it “fits” with this accumulated context. Tokens that are highly relevant to the current context get stronger weights in the state update.</p>

<p>This is like having a conversation where you pay more attention to statements that connect well with the topic you’ve been discussing, while still maintaining a continuous thread of memory.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-system-properties">Dynamic System Properties</h2>

<p>An important insight from our analysis concerns the stability properties of SSMs. The eigenvalues of matrix $A$ determine the model’s behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stable systems</strong> (eigenvalues ≤ 1): Information fades gracefully over time</li>
  <li><strong>Unstable systems</strong> (eigenvalues &gt; 1): Information grows unboundedly, leading to numerical issues</li>
  <li><strong>Oscillating systems</strong> (complex eigenvalues): Create periodic patterns in the output</li>
</ul>

<p>For language modeling, we want stable, non-oscillating behavior. This constrains $A$ to have real, positive eigenvalues bounded by 1, which can be achieved using diagonal matrices with sigmoid-activated elements. This insight has been crucial for modern SSM architectures like S4 [3], Mamba [5], and other recent developments [8,9].</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward-implementation-challenges">Looking Forward: Implementation Challenges</h2>

<p>While theoretically elegant, our proposed context-aware SSM extension faces several practical challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Training Complexity</strong>: The nonlinear similarity term may complicate gradient-based optimization</li>
  <li><strong>Vanishing Gradients</strong>: Like other recurrent models, SSMs can suffer from vanishing gradients over long sequences</li>
  <li><strong>Computational Overhead</strong>: Adding similarity computation increases the computational cost</li>
</ol>

<p>However, we believe the potential benefits - combining SSMs’ efficiency with attention’s context awareness - make this a promising research direction.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The relationship between attention mechanisms and state space models runs deeper than their surface-level differences suggest. Both are solving the same fundamental problem: how to selectively use past information for current predictions.</p>

<p>Attention prioritizes semantic relevance, while SSMs prioritize computational efficiency. Our work suggests that we don’t have to choose - by integrating attention-like similarity measures into SSMs, we may be able to achieve the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>As language models continue to handle longer and longer sequences, finding efficient ways to model context becomes increasingly critical. The marriage of attention and state space concepts may be key to building the next generation of language models that are both computationally efficient and contextually aware.</p>

<p>The journey from attention to state space models and back again reminds us that in machine learning, the most powerful solutions often come from understanding and combining different perspectives on the same underlying problem.</p>

<p>This platform marks a new chapter for us—one where we not only advance research behind the scenes, but also share our journey with the world. We created this website to offer a window into our ongoing work, discoveries, and collaborations. From academic findings to applied insights, this space will keep you up to date with the progress we’re making in the different fields we are currently working on.</p>

<p>As a research lab and chair, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with language and data. But we’re equally committed to openness, communication, dialogue and teaching. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a student, an industry partner, or just curious about what we do—we’re glad you’re here.</p>

<p>You’ll find updates, research highlights, team news, and project showcases.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting—and stay tuned!</p>]]></content><author><name>Götz-Henrik Wiegand</name></author><category term="website" /><category term="chair" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to welcome you to the official website of our DS-NLP Lab.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/preview/pr-12/images/HSG_Daten_01.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/preview/pr-12/images/HSG_Daten_01.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
