I am passionate about developing AI systems that bridge the gap between complex information and human understanding, fostering accessibility, inclusivity, and trust. Central to this vision is the creation of intelligent systems that not only process and organize knowledge but also communicate it in a way that is ethical, user-centered, and actionable. 

This vision is realized through the following interconnected areas of research:

- **Knowledge Extraction and Representation:** I focus on transforming unstructured data into a structured representation to support intelligent reasoning at scale.
- **Context-Aware Natural Language Generation:** I design adaptive systems that simplify complex information while ensuring fairness, inclusivity, and ethical integrity.
- **Computational Argumentation:** I work to improve the quality and accessibility of arguments, creating tools that empower critical thinking, informed decision-making, and effective communication.
